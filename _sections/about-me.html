<p>My name is JoHu, a Chinese boy born after 2000, a Cambridge Economics Fresher and individual music producer. I am super passionate about life - food, music, literature and arts - and would persue them as a life target. I am majored in Economics in Cambridge and this blog would be mainly around that! I would put my class notes, book notes and revision notes here to help me learn better (I hope it would work).</p>
